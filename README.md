# Orbital-Dynamics
Algorithms for Satellite Orbital Dynamics 
caprocks! capstone project for Professor Palmer

Perturbed 2-body problem (one main force(central celestial body))
The Perturbed Restricted 3-body problem (Pertubations + small disturbances) = 2 forces - most deep space spacraft

For opengl now do we decide to go through this lense: 

- :telescope:Project Planning and Requirements Gathering:
Project Planning and Requirements Gathering:

Define the project scope, objectives, and target audience.
Gather requirements for simulation features, visualization capabilities, and user interface design.
Identify the technologies and tools required, including OpenGL for graphics rendering.
Design Phase:

Create a high-level architecture for the simulation platform, outlining the components and their interactions.
Design the user interface, considering user workflows, data input methods, and visualization controls.
Define the data structures and algorithms needed for simulating spacecraft motion and gravitational effects.
Plan the integration of OpenGL for rendering 2D and 3D graphics.
